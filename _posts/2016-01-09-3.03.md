title: Caliburn.Micro 3.0.3 released
---

I've just pushed the `3.0.3` release of Caliburn.Micro to nuget. 

This release reverts [#339](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/pull/339), this PR changed the way Caliburn.Micro resolved views from the container.

Previously the framework only called `GetAllInstances` to attempt to resolve the view, relying on the fact that most containers wouldn't error when the view wasn't resolved.

View Models however were resolved using `GetInstance`. [#339](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/pull/339) made this consistent calling `GetInstance` for both.

This was noted as a breaking change and included in `3.0.2` by mistake, it should not have been included.

Since the release it's become apparent this has been a problem so `3.0.3` reverts this change.

Apologies to anyone affected by this.s
