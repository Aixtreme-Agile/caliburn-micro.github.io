title: Caliburn.Micro 3.1.0 released
---


A small feature and bug fix release to clean out some of the backlog before `4.0.0`. 

Included are the following

- [#439](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/439) Fixes up an issue using commas in constant values `cm:Message.Attach="ShowTitle('One, Two, Three')"`
- [#432](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/432) Stop calling `InitializeCompontent` on Xamarin.Forms, this was mostly used for a underused feature of `.xaml` files without a code behind. On the non-XF platforms this method has re-entry protection, the XF version did not.
- [#423](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/423) Fixes a null reference in the `Setup.WPF` sample.
- [#417](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/417) Handle a `ContentPropertyAttribute` that doesn't supply a property name (WPF's `Frame` does this).
- [#364](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/364) Support `OnViewLoaded` in Xamarin.Forms when the view is a `ContentPage`.
- [#352](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/352) Add an extension point `BindingScope.GetVisualParent` to help people who use visual "bridge" libraries.
- [#319](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/319) Add `$clickedItem` Special Value for WinRT / UWP based projects.
- [#278](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/278) Add a navigation service for WPF and Silverlight with a sample. Note this service may change in `4.0.0` with an effort to align all the navigation services.
- [#247](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/247) Add an extension point on `PropertyChangedBase` and `BindableCollection<T>` named `OnUIThread` to allow people to customize how property changed notifications are dispatched to the UI thread.
