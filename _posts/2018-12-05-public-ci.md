title: Public CI package feed now available
---

Progress is well under way for 4.0.0 and I'm closing in on producing the next alpha. This will contain a majority of the breaking changes regarding moving to an "async first" model across the `Screen` and `Conductor` classes.

In order to quickly gather feeback from the community I've set up a CI (Continuous Integration) pipline using [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) and [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/). This pipeline will publish the packages from any successful build on the `master` branch to this feed.

The CI feed is available for [`Caliburn.Micro.Core`](https://www.myget.org/feed/caliburn-micro-builds/package/nuget/Caliburn.Micro.Core) and [`Caliburn.Micro`](https://www.myget.org/feed/caliburn-micro-builds/package/nuget/Caliburn.Micro).

Thanks to [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/) for providing the public feed.

For anyone who's interested the pipeline itself is defined in the repository at [`azure-pipeline.yml`](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/blob/master/azure-pipeline.yml). Personally I've a big fan of defining as much as we can in declarative fashion including infrastructure and process.

Over time I'll be looking to expand on this to do things such as build / check the samples and create new template packages.
