title: Often unseen contributions
---

Lately I've been thinking about the work that goes into producing open source software and the often unseen contributions people and companies make. These companies provide software often for free to open source projects for often little thanks.

So here's a quick list of the unseen / not really thought about support provided to Caliburn.Micro.

- [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) provides a much needed open source license to Resharper.
- [GitHub](https://github.com) provides Git hosting for the source and the hosting for this website.
- [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) provides VSTS hosting for an experimental (at the moment) build server, an MSDN license for Visual Studio Enterprise and access to product teams for assistance.
- The various control companies [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/), [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com) and [Infragistics](http://www.infragistics.com), with access to the control libraries assists with testing.
- [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com) - When Xamarin was an independent company they provided a Business license.

Without their help I doubt we'd be able to have the software we have today, nor be in a position for even more change in the future.
