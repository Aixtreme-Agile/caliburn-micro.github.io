title: Caliburn.Micro 4.0.62.alpha preview
---

Today I'm really pleased to announce that I've pushed version `4.0.62-alpha` to Nuget. This marks a pretty big step in that most of the interfaces provided by Caliburn.Micro have been migrated to an async implementation. This includes crucial classes for view model lifecycle such as:

- `IActivate`
- `IDeactive`
- `IConductor`
- `IGuardClose`

Obviously a change like thise can seem like a large breaking change, however the nature of these changes make the fixes quite small.

I've started documenting the [changes and migration path to `4.0.0`](/documentation/4.0.0) which I encourage you all to read.

If you want to use more update to date builds as they become available then the CI feed for [`Caliburn.Micro.Core`](https://www.myget.org/feed/caliburn-micro-builds/package/nuget/Caliburn.Micro.Core) and [`Caliburn.Micro`](https://www.myget.org/feed/caliburn-micro-builds/package/nuget/Caliburn.Micro) will be updated on every successful master build.

Most of the changes coming before the beta will be smaller ones, bug fixes and any missing async implementations.
