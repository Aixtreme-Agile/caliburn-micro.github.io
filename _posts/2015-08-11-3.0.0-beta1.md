title: Caliburn.Micro 3.0.0-beta1
---

I'm really pleased to announce the release of **Caliburn.Micro 3.0.0-beta1**, this is a major milestone in that it adds support for a new platform **Universal Windows Platform / Windows 10** as well as for the three new platforms **Xamarin.iOS**, **Xamarin.Android** and **Xamarin.Forms** added in 3.0.0-alpha.

This is an early beta in order to get feedback and testing from the wider community (which is now a lot bigger thanks to 
this release).

All the release notes from [3.0.0-alpha][previous] apply to this release as well.

## Windows 10

The Windows 10 release follows along with the Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 releases and combines them into a single library which is great from a maitenance perspective.  If we need to start adding features specific to Phone, Xbox or even HoloLens they'll be done using feature detection via `Windows.Foundation.Metadata.ApiInformation`.

Also included is a sample showing how to set up a `SplitView` style app with the `Frame` not being the root visual but inside the `ShellView`, this sample is available at [Hello UWP][hello.uwp].

## Preserving state

One new feature in this release is the `CachingFrameAdapter`. This subclass of `FrameAdapter` (which implements `INavigationService` in WinRT platforms such as Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10) will cache internally view models and reuse them on the appropriate navigation. This allows scenarios where the built in `NavigationCacheMode` doesn't make sense but still preserve your view model state. A sample of this in action is available at [Caliburn.Micro.State][state].

## Xamarin Forms

- Included `NavigationHelper` which adds the `For<TViewModel>` method to allow easier view model navigation.

``` csharp
navigationService.For<ProductViewModel>()
    .WithParam(v => v.ProductId, 42)
    .Navigate();
```

## Other Changes 

- Resolved a WPF bug using `MainWindow` when it's disposed. Thanks [dvdorle](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/commits/3.0.0?author=dvdvorle).
- Resolved `ViewLocator.LocateForModelType` failing to deal with improperly reused views in WinRT.
- Resolved a premature garbage collection issue in `Action.Invoke`.
- Removed a unnecessary explicate collection in `FrameAdapter`.
- `BindingScope` has been cleaned up a lot so will be easier to extend.

## Breaking Changes

All the breaking changes from [3.0.0-alpha][previous] apply to this release as well.

- The extensions projects have moved into the main platform assembly, these were initially created as a place for very platform specific code but they've outlived there usefulness and removing them reduces some maintenance costs.
- `Bind.Model` had a feature enabling you to pass a string which used `IoC` to find the model. This was deprecated in 2.0.0 and has now been removed.
- `SimpleContainer` now only uses public constructors. Thanks [belyansky](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/commits/3.0.0?author=belyansky).
- The `UriFor` method has been deprecated in favour of just `For` given the lack of uri support on a number of platforms.
- WinRT platforms now make use of `AssemblySourceCache` which means if your view models do not implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` or views subclass from `UIElement` then they may not be found by `ViewLocator` or `ViewModelLocator`. This behaviour can be changed by modifying `AssemblySourceCache.ExtractTypes`.

## How do I get this?

For Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android or Windows 10 simply use the normal Nuget package [Caliburn.Micro](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Caliburn.Micro/), if you're wanting to checkout Xamarin.Forms then use the package [Caliburn.Micro.Xamarin.Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Caliburn.Micro.Xamarin.Forms/).

Previously the code for all these new features was spread across a number of branches, it's now consolidated in a single [3.0.0 branch][branch].

## Where to from here?

- More Xamarin testing.
- Expand on the platform specific samples.
- Expand on the platform specific documentation.
