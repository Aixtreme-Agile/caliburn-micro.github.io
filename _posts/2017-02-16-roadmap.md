title: Roadmap announced

Today I've published the [Roadmap][roadmap] for Caliburn.Micro, this will help codify the direction over the first half of the year. The idea is to sketch out in broad strokes the areas that will be focussed on and what will be needed.

I'm considering trying out GitHub projects to help drive development effort for these broad *sections*.

Have a [read][roadmap] and let me know what you think.
