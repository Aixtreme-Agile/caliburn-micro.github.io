---


This is a minor bug fix release.

- Fixed support for child view models at design time. [#214](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/214), [#358](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/358), [#359](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/359), [#379](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/379) 
- `Caliburn.Micro.Xamarin.Forms` nuget package now depends on `Caliburn.Micro` for applications helping to ensure you have all the right packages. [#323](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/323) 
- Stopped extra calls to `InitializeComponent` in Xaamarin.Forms. [#326](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/326) 
- Support .NET 4.0 in the `Caliburn.Micro.Start` nuget package. [#348](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/348) 
- Ensure view model activation and deactivation is happening on back navigation in Xamarin.Forms. [#342](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/342) 
- `ContentView` bindings correctly deal with message targets in Xamarin.Forms. [#349](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/349) 
- Convention added for `DocumentViewer` in WPF. [#368](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/368) 
- Added some generic overloads to methods on SimpleContainer. [#390](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/390) 
- `ViewLocator` will now correctly call `GetInstance` for resolution of the view falling back to manual instantiation. [#339](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/339)

The highest impact bug fix for this release is the last one, previously the `ViewModelLocator` would call `GetInstance` to try to resolve the view model (falling back to `GetAllInstances` and then manual instantiation), `ViewLocator` however previously only called `GetAllInstances`. 

This release makes them consistent, however it could cause problems if you're throwing exceptions on no resolution of a service from the container. I'd recommend if you are doing this checking whether the type is assignable to `UIElement` (or some view type) and return `null` (or skip throwing the exception).
